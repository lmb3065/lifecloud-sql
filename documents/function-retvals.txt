TO DO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * General : Remove all stupid 'Oh no we got more than one item by PK' checks
 * admin_create_admin_account() : REWRITE
        add "admin user already exists" bailout
 * get_member_apps() : log "can't find requested Member" error
 * log_permissions_error() : rewrite to use new codes
 * member_can_update_member() : rewrite to use new codes
 * update_member: add smarter 'no such member' check
 * update_session: check that MID exists
